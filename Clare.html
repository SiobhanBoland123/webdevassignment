<h2> Where to stay </h2>
<h3> The Armada Hotel, Spanish Point</h3>
<p>
It’s the perfect location - Spanish Point in Co Clare epitomises what the Wild Atlantic Way is all about - vast skies over breathtaking Atlantic views, salt breezes whetting the 
appetite for an abundance of local seafood, walking the nearby Cliffs of Moher or a short spin to the Burren or Loop Head.
The breathtaking bedroom views; or dining in The Ocean Bar, Johnny Burkes Bar or The Pearl Restaurant; the sensory delights of the freshest seafood paired with locally sourced vegetables and their own homemade pantry products - desserts, jams, breads....

<h3>  Cliffs of Moher </h3>
 <p> 
 Beyond the grounds of the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience you can now explore a new 20km coastal walking trail in Clare which will bring you along one of the most outstanding landscapes of Ireland. From LIscannor and Hags 
 Head in the south, along by the majestic Cliffs of Moher and to Doolin in the North, with views over Aill Na Searrach, the Aran Islands and Galway Bay.
 Nature’s wonders surround you at the Cliffs of Moher.
  The trail follows the line of the cliffs and passes through the grounds of the visitor centre. 
  With a due-west exposure, sunset is the best time to visit.

    <h2>Sightseeing & Atrractions </h2>
<h3>  Doolin Cave, Doolin </h3>
 <p> 
Doolin Cave is home to the Great Stalactite. At 7.3 metres (23feet) it is the longest free-hanging stalactite in the Northern Hemisphere. The Great Stalactite, suspended from the ceiling like a chandelier, is truly astounding. Visitors can hardly believe that it was formed from a single drop of water over thousands of years. Extend the adventure from underground to over ground following a charming Farmland Nature Trail that takes a looped walk around the cave setting. The nature trail is home to indigenous species of flora along with rare and miniature breeds of animals/ More
