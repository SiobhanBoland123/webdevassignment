 <h2> Activites </h2>
<h3> Cycling to Muckross Abbey </h3>
 <p> 
16 km and very scenic and mostly flat. You can walk over the Old Weir Bridge its very scenic, Arbutus the Strawberry Tree grows here in abundance, when ripe its red otherwise you will find Yellow berries. So its back on the bikes and you will arrive at the Main road with cars and buses so be careful for 500 meters before you arrive at Torc Waterfall. After 500 meters on the left is Dundag Beach a freshwater beach popular with locals in hot weather, next on the left is the Muckross Boathouse before you arrive at Muckross House & Gardens.
