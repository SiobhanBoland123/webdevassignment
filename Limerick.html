 <h2> Activites </h2>
<h3> Living Bridge, UL </h3>
 <p> 
“The Living Bridge – An Droichead Beo” is a unique design by Wilkinson Eyre Architects, London and consists of seven 50-metre spans linked together by piers which create four platforms of refuge for walkers.

The platforms are designed to accommodate social gatherings, informal teaching sessions, music and dance performances, as well as a wide array of educational, social and cultural activities – all contributing to this facility’s status as a “living” bridge”.
The bridge alternates between rhythms of bridge and island, with lightweight bridge structures joining to more solid pier locations.
