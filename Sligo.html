<h2> Activites </h2>
<h3>  Snorkeling in Mullaghmore </h3>
<p> 
Snorkeling is swimming through the water while wearing a diving mask, snorkel and fins. This gear allows you to see the amazing beauty that lies beneath the surface for long periods of time with a small amount of effort. It is a relaxing and interesting way to spend a few hours and you see something new every time.  Snorkeling is done without all the complicated equipment and training that is required for scuba diving and allows us to enjoy the underwater life in their natural habitat.

<h2> Where to eat</h2>
<h3> Food in Cawleys </h3>
<p>
With a wide range of items on their menu and set menus, Cawleys really seems like the prefect place for dinner. 
On the tables the placemats double as the menu and the children’s menu has a colouring competition to keep the little monsters amused. 
The wine list is a good selection of reds & whites all priced at €19.95 a bottle or by the glass for €5.00, the selection includes wines from New Zealand, South Africa and Italy as well as a Chilean sparkling for that special day.
